        <h2>About MathMaze</h2>
        <p>
            MathMaze was inspired by my passion for both math and gaming. Growing up, I always found joy in solving math problems and getting lost in intricate maze games. Combining these two elements seemed like a perfect way to create an engaging and educational experience. This project started as a simple idea and evolved into a full-fledged game during my time at Holberton School. It is a part of my portfolio project, showcasing the skills I have acquired throughout my journey. I hope MathMaze inspires others to find the fun in learning math.
